## Question: How U.S society has changed in 1972 vs 2012 based on working status and marital status?

Many people believe as more people working as less people gonna married. That thesis appear many times on newspaper so I want to use statistic to verify that thesis.

1. Check independence of workting status and martial status.

2. Check the propotion of working status in 1972 compare with 2012

3. Check the propotion of marital status in 1972 compare with 2012
